# Linux-Verse
Linux-Verse is your perfect beginner-friendly guide To Linux. I will explain everything you NEED TO KNOW whether you use noob OSes like Linux Lite or Zorin (Linux Distros) or something more intermediate. Here are some Things to Know;

# What is Linux?
It's not really an OS but a Kernel. Now what's that? it's the base software used to code an OS and is used by windows and MacOS. The difference is that the Linux Kernel is open-source and available for anyone to download, or Modify. Though to modify the Kernel on global scale you need to take permission from `The Linux Foundation`. So why do people refer to Linux as an OS, well because it actually is! it's a general term used for Linux OSes. So whhy do people say `Switch to Linux` instead of naming an OS. Well, why do people say `Is Windows Better or MacOS?` instead of refering to a specific version like `Windows 11`. You'll say: `because there are several versions`. That's the case with Linux. It has a broad range of **Distributions** (distros for short) each one tailoured to a different use, with many being just copies of one another. When you google `"How many Linux Oses are there?"` you'll see something like `600`. But that's not true! there are something like only 30 that work and are available for Download. Here are the Components a typical Linux Distro consists of:

# 1. Desktop Enviroment(DE):-
It's the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of an OS. In other words the thing that allows you to see your mouse, wallpaper and apps. Windows and MacOS use proprietary DEs, but Linux distros don't. Every Linux DE is completely open-source meaning you can use the one you Like on any distro. Here are Some of the Best ones: 

1. GNOME: <br>

# 2. Family Tree / Category:
There are three different families a typical distro belongs to and these are: Ubuntu-Debian Family, Fedora-Red Hat Family and Arch-Gentoo family. 
`NOTE: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat, Arch and Gentoo are distros too`

# 3. Package Management:
Each family has its own set of commands and come with there own file formats for every application `(similar to how Windows uses the file format .exe)` and are often called `Native Packages`. However in the Recent years there are Universal Package Managers too. These, `as the name suggests`, have a universal file format and a universal command. In this, there are three different types too. Here's the Complete guide on this Topic:

# Native Package Managers of Ubuntu-Debian Family:
Any distro that belongs to this category will use the `.deb` file format and the `apt` command. With the `apt` command you can perform a number of tasks that are usually performed by the Software Centre: 
```
sudo apt install # to install an app
sudo apt update # to update apps
sudo apt remove # to remove an app
```
`.deb` is just a file format used by applications to be installed. Here are two ways to run `.deb` files: <br>
a) Open it via the Software Centre of your distro or <br>
b) Run it via the Terminal: <br>
   1. locate where the file is installed, then right-click in the folder and choose the `"Open terminal Here"` option
   2. Then run it like this:
   ```
   sudo dpkg -i package.deb # replace package.deb with the name of your package
   ```
