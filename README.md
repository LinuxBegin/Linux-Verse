# Linux-Verse
Linux-Verse is your perfect beginner-friendly guide To Linux. I will explain everything you NEED TO KNOW whether you use noob OSes like Linux Lite or Zorin (Linux Distros) or something more intermediate. Here are some Things to Know;

# What is Linux?
It's not really an OS but a Kernel. Now what's that? it's the base software used to code an OS and is used by windows and MacOS. The difference is that the Linux Kernel is open-source and available for anyone to download, or Modify. Though to modify the Kernel on global scale you need to take permission from `The Linux Foundation`. So why do people refer to Linux as an OS, well because it actually is! it's a general term used for Linux OSes. So whhy do people say `Switch to Linux` instead of naming an OS. Well, why do people say `Is Windows Better or MacOS?` instead of refering to a specific version like `Windows 11`. You'll say: `because there are several versions`. That's the case with Linux. It has a broad range of **Distributions** (distros for short) each one tailoured to a different use, with many being just copies of one another. When you google `"How many Linux Oses are there?"` you'll see something like `600`. But that's not true! there are something like only 30 that work and are available for Download. Here are the Components a typical Linux Distro consists of:

# 1. Desktop Enviroment(DE):-
It's the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of an OS. In other words the thing that allows you to see your mouse, wallpaper and apps. Windows and MacOS use proprietary DEs, but Linux distros don't. Every Linux DE is completely open-source meaning you can use the one you Like on any distro. Here are Some of the Best ones: 

1. GNOME: <br>

# 2. Family Tree / Category:
There are three different families and a typical distro will belong to any one and these are: Ubuntu-Debian Family, Fedora-Red Hat Family and Arch-Gentoo family. 
`NOTE: Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Red Hat, Arch and Gentoo are distros too`

# 3. Package Management:
Each family has its own set of commands and come with there own file formats for every application `(similar to how Windows uses the file format .exe)` and are often called `Native Packages`. However in the Recent years there are Universal Package Managers too. These, `as the name suggests`, have a universal file format and a universal command. In this, there are three different types too. Here's the Complete guide on this Topic:

# Native Package Managers of Ubuntu-Debian Family:
Any distro that belongs to this category will use the `.deb` file format and the `apt` command. With the `apt` command you can perform a number of tasks that are usually performed by the Software Centre: 
```
sudo apt install # to install an app from the available reposotory
sudo apt update # to update apps
sudo apt remove # to remove an app
```
NOTE: If you see the error `package not found` then it means the app you are looking for is either no longer maintained or uses it's own repository. These can be found by looking into the official site or asking ChatGPT to search the web for it.


Though you could use the app center for most of your apps, you might want to use this method in case the app you're looking for is not in the app center but available on the web: <br> 

a) Install the app you want in the `.deb ` format and open it via the Software Centre of your distro or <br>
b) Run it via the Terminal: <br>
   1. locate where the file is installed, then right-click in the folder and choose the `"Open terminal Here"` option
   2. Then run it like this:
   ```
   sudo dpkg -i package.deb # replace package.deb with the name of your package
   ```
I've already mentioned the method for removing a .deb file, `sudo apt remove packagename`. However if you are unable to find the correct name stored you can type `dpkg --list` in the terminal and it will show every package installed, by the way they are in Aplhabetical order.

# Package Mangement in Fedora-Red hat Family:
Such distros use the `.rpm` file format and the `dnf` command which again can be used to perform a number of tasks, for example:
```
sudo dnf update # to update
sudo dnf install # to install packages or dependencies from the native repository
```

Now to install apps you can either search the app center or use the `.rpm` file of your app and run it in two ways: <br>
   1) Via the app center <br>
   2) Via the Terminal like this: 
      ```
      sudo dnf install ./package.rpm # replace "package.rpm" with the actual package name
      ```

NOTE: Whilst using the `sudo dnf install command` you face an error that says `package not found` you can either search the web for it's new repo or enable the `Copr Repository`. These are community maintained repos of apps or commands or packages or dependencies that no longer exist and each comes with their own specific Copr repo. However if you wish to install them without adding a copr repo for each manually you can do the following:
```
sudo dnf install \
  https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm

sudo dnf install \
  https://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm
```
If your app, package, or dependencies is available in these it will be installed automatically by typing `sudo dnf install webkit # just an example`

To remove apps installed via the terminal or through the `.rpm` file format:
```
sudo dnf remove package # replace 'package' with the actual name of the app or package you want to delete
```
NOTE: If you are unable to find the correct name, do the following because unlike ubuntu there's no easy command: <br>
1) Open the file explorer
2) Go to the Home tab and press Ctrl + H. This will list hidden files and folders
3) now open the `.bashrc` file and add this to the last line:
   ```
   alias list--package="rpm -qa"
   ```
4) Lastly open the terminal and type this new command `list--package` and it will list every single package. To Find your specific package use the grep command like this:
   ```
   list--package | grep chrome # just an example, you can replace chrome with the first name of your desired app or package 
   ```

# Package Management for Arch-Gentoo Family:
Sorry i don't currently have a guide on this.

# Universal Package Management:
There are three universal packages: Snaps, Flatpaks and Appimages. To Know more about them click on the following Links: <br>

# Best Linux Distros:
Here are some of the best Linux Distros, each with a comprehensive Intro. I will provide the Links to the respective websites and downloads page.

# 1. Zorin OS:
It's the best and the most user-friendly Linux distro available. It has buit-in support for several Windows apps and minimizes the need for a terminal, everything is done via the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and is therefore the only OS made primarily to act as an Alternative for windows 10. It also belongs to the Ubuntu-Debian family and comes in two editions: Zorin OS core (Free) and Zorin OS Pro (Non-free) for which you have to pay. To Know more here's the [Website](https://zorin.com/os/). If you are someone who just wants an alternative to windows, Zorin is an Excellent choice. Another thing to mention is that it uses the GNOME desktop enviroment.

# 2. Linux Mint:
The Most beginner friendly distro that belongs to the Ubuntu-Debian Family. It's based on the latest releases of Ubuntu and therefore has long term support. It comes with it's own desktop enviroment "Cinnamon" that is also available for other Linux Oses. It comes in three different editions: Cinnamon, Xfce and MATE. Being Linux you have the option to use the latest kernels by installing them through this [app](https://github.com/bkw777/mainline). Here's the [Webpage](https://linuxmint.com/). Overall it's amazing if you are new to Linux as when you install apps through the `.deb` package format its automatically linked to the App Center allowing you to delete the app you want by right-clicking

# 3. Ubuntu:
Yes! the base distro itself is pretty amazing. Very user-friendly with the latest apps and technology. It's best use case is in Servers or for advanced programming and Arduino Projects. This is not because it uses some special edition or version of the Arduino IDE rather just broader hardware support and much more refined compatibility alongside longevity. By default it uses the latest version of GNOME DE but comes in different "Flavours", basically the same OS but with diffrent pre-configured and slightly changed DEs. It uses Snap packages because the Company behind it, Canonical, are the people who develop and Maintain it. Another remarkable feature is that it's Enterprise grade, so you can expect proper security and documentation on key issues. Here's the [Website](https://ubuntu.com/)
